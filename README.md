Rationals
===============
You will work with an existing code base to implement an abstract class and two children of that abstract class. The classes will represent a fraction consisting of a numerator and denominator. The methods on the class with be operations to add, subtract, multiply, etc. two Rationals. The classes generally follow a philosophy of immutability, in which the methods do not alter either of the Rationals being operated on but instead return a third new Rational that is the result of the operation.
